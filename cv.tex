\section*{Skills}
\subsection*{Programming}
Through my professional life, hobbyist coding and studies, I have learned: 
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt ,parsep=2pt]
\item WinForms development with C\#
\item Perl, Python and Bash scripting
\item Web development through CGI scripts as well as frameworks such as Django and Webapp
\item Javascript with Mootools, jQuery and various client-side templating tools
\item Using different threading including various synchronisation mechanisms including variable locks and mutexes, including issues that can arise in real-time scenarios.
\item Java and LISP
\item iPhone and Android development.
\item Use of revision control systems such as Git, SVN and Microsoft Team Foundation Server.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{System Administration}
During my work for Multiplay and Smoothwall along with lots of personal interest I have learnt many things in the area of system administration including:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt ,parsep=2pt]
\item Administration of many varieties of Unix (including Gentoo, Fedora and Ubuntu distributions of Linux and FreeBSD), Mac OS X and Windows systems.
\item Network design, implementation and troubleshooting.
\item Configuration of vital network services such as DHCP, DNS, Routing and Proxies (such as Squid).
\item Development with and administration of a variety of database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite.
\item Apache and nginx configuration including virtual hosts and use of various modules (such as SVN and Python).
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Soft Skills}
Over my life of work and study, I have gained soft skills which are vital to be productive in a working environment.
Communication is a key element of these skills and these have been honed extensively, from talking and producing specifications as part of my work on development projects and dealing with end users in my positions at the LAN parties.
Working as part of a team is also something which I am growing adapt at, building on top of good communication, I can take control of a group and delegate work effectively.
\section*{Interests}
Outside of my studies and work life, I try to maintain a set of interests closely related to the work and studies that I do.
Part of me has the desire to know everything about something I'm interested in until I cannot learn any more and this is reflected in the extremes I can take my hobbies to.
The best example of this is my home network, which consists of extremely configurable hardware such that I can use the network as a test bed for many different services, such that I can experience the systems in an environment which is not service critical.

However, I do like to get away from computers and experience the outside world. I enjoy getting out into the woods and playing some Paintball, which is a team intensive exercise.
Additionally, I have a passion for the technical side of theatre, be it lighting a stage or assisting behind it, I enjoy seeing a show come together from rehearsals, through design and construction and to the final performance.
