\section*{Experience}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Insight Software - Software Developer} \\
Summer 2009 & Insight Software is a relatively small development company making software for large businesses to help them manage and plan their finances.
I spent 2 months over the summer break as a software developer on back-end services for their enterprise software {\it Insight}.
This included a full scheduler (similar to cron) for generating reports against a business management back-end such as Oracle E-Business
and an easy to understand interface to allow users to add jobs to the scheduler and administrators to control the scheduler. \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Southwest LANs - Game server administrator} \\
2008-Present & Southwest LANs is a LAN party company who run the LeachLAN Series of events.
I work as a game server administrator at their events, running many different server software in a variety of different configurations which all involve their own unique touch.
To assist in this, I wrote a web-based administration tool using Django and Python to improve the creation process of servers based on template configurations which are changed when the server configuration is deployed to a target server.
This role also requires me to maintain a link with the customers attending the event to understand what they need from the game servers.\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Multiplay UK - i-Series Yellow Shirt} \\
2009-Present & Multiplay UK is a gaming company who run the UK's largest LAN party (the i-Series) as well as being a large online community and game server provider.
A yellow shirt is responsible for running the customer facing helpdesk which acts as front line technical support and communicating network issues to the core network team.
The team also assists other staff members in various tasks involved in running the event such as helping exhibitors and activities on stage.

\section*{Skills}
\subsection*{System Administration}
During my work for Multiplay and Southwest LANs along with lots of personal interest I have learnt many things in the area of system administration including:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt ,parsep=2pt]
\item Administration of many varieties of Unix (including Gentoo, Fedora and Ubuntu distributions of Linux and FreeBSD), Mac OS X and Windows systems.
\item Network design, implementation and troubleshooting including usage of Cisco's IOS configuration terminal.
\item Configuration of vital network services such as DHCP, DNS, Routing and Proxies (such as Squid).
\item Usage of a variety of database systems including MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite.
\item Apache configuration including virtual hosts and use of various modules (such as SVN and Python).
\item Configuration and maintenance of a ZFS pool.
\item Initial set up and maintenance of an LDAP directory, used for RADIUS authentication as well as other unified credential network services such as Samba.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Programming}
Part of the course I am studying at university and working for Insight as well as a hobby, I have learnt a few programming languages and refined some of them to a high level. These skills include:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt ,parsep=2pt]
\item Refined use of Microsoft's .net languages including C\# as a primary language.
\item Plenty of experience using different threading including various synchronisation mechanisms including variable locks and mutexes.
\item Designing and programming support for network applications using both TCP unicast and UDP broadcast and multicast.
\item Scripting in Perl and various shells such as Bash and Windows PowerShell.
\item iPhone development.
\item Additional experience in Python, LISP, Java and C.
\item Use of revision control systems such as SVN and Microsoft Team Foundation Server.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Soft Skills}
Over my life of work and study, I have gained soft skills which are vital to be productive in a working environment.
Communication is a key element of these skills and these have been honed extensively, from talking and producing specifications as part of my work on development projects and dealing with end users in my positions at the LAN parties.
Working as part of a team is also something which I am growing adapt at, building on top of good communication, I can take control of a group and delegate work effectively.
\section*{Interests}
Outside of my studies and work life, I try to maintain a set of interests closely related to the work and studies that I do.
Part of me has the desire to know everything about something I'm interested in until I cannot learn any more and this is reflected in the extremes I can take my hobbies to.
The best example of this is my home network, which consists of extremely configurable hardware such that I can use the network as a test bed for many different services, such that I can experience the systems in an environment which is not service critical.

However, I do like to get away from computers and experience the outside world. I enjoy getting out into the woods and playing some Paintball, which is a team intensive exercise.
Additionally, I have a passion for the technical side of theatre, be it lighting a stage or assisting behind it, I enjoy seeing a show come together from rehearsals, through design and construction and to the final performance.
