{\bf Moonfruit - Platform Developer} & April 2014 - Present \\
\multicolumn{2}{X}{
As a Platform Developer working on Moonfruit's website builder software I work on the team tasked with rebuilding the product from scratch.
This includes integrating various language's build systems (Python's {\tt distutils} and {\tt grunt} for JavaScript) into the CI, ultimately producing Debian packages.
These packages can then be used in the integration environment that I implemented using Vagrant and Puppet.
This allows developers to have a working install of the software within minutes, despite the complexity of the disparate services that powers it.
On top of this, I also participate in the design and implementation of the various backend services which use a mix of Django and Flask, backed by a PostgreSQL database.

{\bf Smoothwall Ltd. - Junior Developer} & July 2012 - April 2014 \\
\multicolumn{2}{X}{
I acted as a Maintenance Developer, covering three roles: developer, sysadmin and third line support.
As a developer, I spent most of my time fixing bugs in Smoothwall's various Linux based firewall and web filtering products,
across Perl, JavaScript and C codebases.
This included package maintenance tasks, updating in-house packaging for new upstream versions and applying security patches.
As well as working on the product, I was also responsible for the CI systems that build the product.
This included a complete rewrite of the ISO and patch build processes, moving away from a collection of Makefiles and shell scripts to a unit tested Perl framework.
Finally, I performed a third line support role, assisting the main support teams in debugging problems on customer's sites.

{\bf Smoothwall Ltd. - Placement Sysadmin} & July 2010 - Aug 2011 \\
\multicolumn{2}{X}{
Year long internship as a gap between my second and third years of University.
During the year, I performed first line technical support for the office, as well as designing and implementing IT systems used both internally and externally.
This included creating and updating a number of services to integrate a Google Apps domain into existing systems.

{\bf Insight Software - Software Developer} & Summer 2009 \\
\multicolumn{2}{X}{
I spent 2 months over the summer break as a software developer on backend services for their enterprise software {\it Insight}.
This included the implementation of a report scheduler system in C\# for generating PDFs based on data sourced from ERP systems.
}

{\bf Multiplay UK - i-Series Event Volunteer} & 2009 - Present \\
\multicolumn{2}{X}{
I volunteer to assist running the running of Multiplay's i-series events as a "Yellow Shirt" team leader.
This involves guiding the set up of power and network infrastructure as well as running the customer facing helpdesk which provides first line technical support to attendees.
Outside of the event, I assist in the planning, communicating feedback and ideas from the team to the event organizers.

\section*{Education}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l X }
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf University of Southampton} \\
2008-2012 & 
2.i BSc in Computer Science.
Modules include: Scripting Languages, Networks, Databases, Architecture and Security.
Final project covered the specification and implementation of a REST based interface for a Publish/Subscribe service,
with the implementation targeted at disseminating notifications when a semantic web document is updated.
This allows derivative works to update when the source is changed without having to be constantly re-rendered.\\
